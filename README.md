# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

I wrote an Employee Management System in C# that allows users to add, edit, view, and delete employee records. The system stores employee details such as ID, name, department, position, and salary. It also saves this data to a text file and can load the saved data when the program starts.

The purpose of writing this software was to demonstrate key C# concepts, such as object-oriented programming, file I/O operations using the System.IO library, input validation, and exception handling. This project helped solidify my understanding of these C# features.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code as the main tool to write and run the C# code, with the .NET Core SDK for compiling the project. I also used GitHub to track changes and manage the project.

The programming language is C#, which is object-oriented and part of the .NET framework. I used the System.IO library to handle reading and writing files.
